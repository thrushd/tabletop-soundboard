# Example SD card
This directory is meant to give you an example for how the micro SD card should be set up. Simply copy the contents of this folder to a card and slot it in to explore how the device works.

## Sounds
I like to use a simple naming scheme for my files, to help keep things organized (since it's a flat layout). Names start with a broad category (`ambiance`, `effect`, etc), and get more specific from there. That way you can sort by name and everything orders nicely.
