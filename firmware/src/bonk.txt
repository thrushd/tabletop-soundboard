Now:
    Scene 1
        track 1
        track 2
        track 3
        ...
    Scene 2
        track 1
        track 2
        track 3

Want:
    1d array of scene names
        ["Camp", "Tavern", "Mountains", ...]

    2d array of tracks grouped by scene
        [[S1T1, S2T1, S3T1, S4T1, ...],
         [S1T2, S2T2, S3T2, S4T2, ...],
         [S1T3, S2T3, S3T3, S4T3, ...]]
            
- Also need logic for a module object handling an empty track
